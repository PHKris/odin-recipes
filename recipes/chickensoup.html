        <h1>Chicken Soup Recipe</h1>

            <img src="./images/chickensoup.jpg" alt="Chicken Soup Cover Image">

            <p>Your basic chicken soup recipe found in most general cook books. It is the old reliable of chicken soup recipes. I appreciated the hint to cut the carrots, celery and onions in half. I had always cut them up in small pieces, and then when I would drain the broth, it was messy to try to retrieve the cut up veggies to put them back in the broth. This is so much easier! When I drain the broth, I place a paper towel in the sieve. It makes for a nice clear broth. I also cook up some noodles to add to the soup. I do not like to add the noodles directly to the pot of soup, because the noodles will aborb too much of the broth.</p>

            <p>Chicken soup can be a relatively low fat food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top. A study determined that "prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH".</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken </li>

                <li>1 large onion, halved </li>
                <li>water to cover </li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Put the chicken, carrots, celery and onion in a large soup pot and cover with cold water. Heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken meat falls off of the bones (skim off foam every so often).</li>
                <li>Take everything out of the pot. Strain the broth. Pick the meat off of the bones and chop the carrots, celery and onion. Season the broth with salt, pepper and chicken bouillon to taste, if desired. Return the chicken, carrots, celery and onion to the pot, stir together, and serve.</li>
